Notes on how to build and install Terminate from source

1. CMake
The default build system for Terminate is CMake.
For those not familiar with it, it stands for Cross plat-
form Make and you can find more info on www.cmake.org

1.2 CMake Linux
Most distros have CMake in their package installers.
Ubuntu:
    #aptitude or apt-get
    sudo aptitude install cmake
Fedora
    sudo yum install cmake

Make sure that SDL1.2-dev is installed
    aptitude search libsdl1.2-dev
    aptitude search libsdl-image1.2-dev


See build options for installing without SDL

Then to build and install Terminate:
terminate/$ mkdir build
terminate/$ cd build;
terminate/build/$ cmake ../ [options]
terminate/build/$ make
terminate/build/$ make install

Some systems require 'sudo' for the last step.
CMake will also set the install path of libraries to 
/usr/local. Some linuxs doesn't have this path in the 
system's search paths. 
Either add /usr/local/lib/ to your systems search path, or
set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the desired location when
running CMake.

1.3 Cmake osX
The build and install should be equal to Linux

However the GNU libstdc++ provided by osx mayi be out of 
date and thereby lacking certain C++11 functionality. This 
typically manifests itself in failing to compile because 
<cstdint> is missing and there's no std::unique_ptr defined
in <memory>. 
This can be solved by turning on the LLVMlibcxx option,
causing clang to link to llvms c++ stdlib instead. 
See section 2. build options

2. CMake build options
It's possible to give CMake the following
project specific options:

-DUseSDL=OFF                    # Disables installing SDL 
                                # dependent components. 
                                # Demos are disabled.

-DBuildDemos=OFF                # Don't build the demos :(

-DLLVMcxx=ON                    # Link LLVM's libc++ as 
                                # standard library. 
                                # -stdlib=libc++

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[path]   # Provide CMake with a dif- 
                                # ferent install location.

Make sure to configure CMake in a clean directory.
